KidsPlaza Facebook Ads Pipeline powers the internal ETL process at KidsPlaza, automating the ingestion, transformation, and loading of digital advertising data into our centralized Google BigQuery warehouse.

It integrates Facebook Ads Insights data, supporting both daily sync and historical backfills. The pipeline is structured around modular stages such as fetch, enrich, ingest, staging, and mart, making it easier to test, maintain, and extend.
