KidsPlaza TikTok Ads Pipeline powers the internal ETL process at KidsPlaza, automating the ingestion, transformation, and loading of digital advertising data into our centralized Google BigQuery warehouse.

It integrates TikTok Ads insights data, supporting both daily sync and historical backfills. The pipeline is structured around modular stages such as fetch, enrich, ingest, staging and materialization to make it easier to test, maintain, and extend.
