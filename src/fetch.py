TIKTOK FETCHING MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------------
This module handles authenticated data retrieval from the TikTok 
Marketing API, consolidating all campaign, ad, creative, and metadata 
fetching logic into a unified, maintainable structure for ingestion.

It ensures reliable access to TikTok Ads data with controlled rate 
limits, standardized field mapping, and structured outputs for 
downstream enrichment and transformation stages.

✔️ Initializes secure TikTok SDK sessions and retrieves credentials  
✔️ Fetches campaign, ad, and creative data via authenticated API calls  
✔️ Handles pagination, rate limiting and error retries automatically  
✔️ Returns normalized and schema-ready DataFrames for processing  
✔️ Logs detailed runtime information for monitoring and debugging  

⚠️ This module focuses solely on data retrieval and extraction.  
It does not perform schema enforcement, data enrichment, or 
storage operations such as uploading to BigQuery.
