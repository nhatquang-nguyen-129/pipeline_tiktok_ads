TIKTOK MATERIALIZATION MODULE
------------------------------------------------------------------
This module builds the mart layer for TikTok Ads by aggregating 
and transforming data from staging tables generated during the 
raw layer ingestion process. 

It focuses on preparing final analytical tables for cost tracking 
and campaign performance reporting at a daily granularity.

‚úîÔ∏è Dynamically detects all campaign staging tables for the target year  
‚úîÔ∏è Applies transformation and standardization (type cast, parsing)  
‚úîÔ∏è Writes partitioned & clustered materialized tables to Google BigQuery

‚ö†Ô∏è This module is strictly responsible for *MART layer construction*.  
It does not handle raw data ingestion, API fetching, or enrichment logic.
